# iMac G3 replacement parts
These files are an attempt at recreating some of the parts of an iMac G3 for a casemod.
My inner bezel shattered while disassembling, so a replacement was needed. 
I will also add mounting points for an LCD display.

## To do list:
1. Replacement parts
* ~IO 'shield'~ (Overall shape correct, only mounting mechanism and port selection left)
* Backplate (access panel for RAM or video port in the original)
2. New parts
* LCD mount
* Mounts for m-ITX board, SFF-PSU, GPU and HDD/SSD

## Notes:
### Bezel:
#### After attempt 2 (bottom left):
* ~Curve Left-Right is 2mm too high near the center of each part. => Mount to outer bezel too high as well.~
* ~Curve around the display in base shape is too small, should curve more to fill in the edges.~ (From 6 to 9mm)
* ~Part did not include holes for assembly in the middle.~ (Maybe look for another solution as well)
* Left and right edge can grow 1 or 2mm towards the outside. **I like a little breathing room**
* Try printing top part next time to see if upper curve fits + where mounting holes need to go. **Only when bottom part fits**
#### After attempt 3 (bottom left):
* ~Left and right edges are too high => about 6mm on the top surface.~
* ~Mounting holes on the bottom do not align => about 1mm lower.~
* ~Mounting holes on the bottom need to be thinner to fit in between outer bezel and metal frame.~ (from 3mm to 1.5)
#### After attempt 4 (bottom left):
* Curve from left to right still isn't perfect, but it fits good enough for me.
* ~Bottom right part should have a surface for power button to rest against.~ (modeled but untested. Power button itself fits well over the led and inside the button.)
* ~**Time to try and fit the top, fingers crossed**~ :c
#### After attempt 5 (top left):
* Top curve too far inward.

### IO Shield:
#### After attempt 2: 
* Curve is more or less there, not perfect, but good enough.
* Size is also pretty close.
* Angle of ports is not right yet. Need to measure again.
