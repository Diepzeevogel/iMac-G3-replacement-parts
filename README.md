# iMac G3 replacement parts
These files are an attempt at recreating some of the parts of an iMac G3 for a casemod.
My inner bezel shattered while disassembling, so a replacement was needed. 
I will also add mounting points for an LCD display.

This build is finished. Instructions and why not to do this can be found on hackaday.io: https://hackaday.io/project/160719-imac-g3-casemod
