# iMac G3 replacement parts
These files are an attempt at recreating some of the parts of an iMac G3 for a casemod.
My inner bezel shattered while disassembling, so a replacement was needed. 
I will also add mounting points for an LCD display.

### To do list:
1. Replacement parts
* ~IO 'shield'~ (V1 ready to print)
* Backplate (access panel for RAM or video port in the original)
2. New parts
* LCD mount
* Mounts for m-ITX board, SFF-PSU, GPU and HDD/SSD

### Notes:
#### After attempt 2 (bottom left):
* ~Curve Left-Right is 2mm too high near the center of each part. => Mount to outer bezel too high as well.~
* ~Curve around the display in base shape is too small, should curve more to fill in the edges.~ (From 6 to 9mm)
* ~Part did not include holes for assembly in the middle.~ (Maybe look for another solution as well)
* Left and right edge can grow 1 or 2mm towards the outside.
* Try printing top part next time to see if upper curve fits + where mounting holes need to go.
