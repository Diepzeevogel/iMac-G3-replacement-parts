# iMac G3 replacement parts
These files are an attempt at recreating some of the parts of an iMac G3 for a casemod.
My inner bezel shattered while disassembling, so a replacement was needed. 
I will also add mounting points for an LCD display.

### To do list:
1. Replacement parts
..* IO 'shield'
..* Backplate (access panel for RAM or video port in the original)
2. New parts
..* LCD mount
..* Mounts for m-ITX board, SFF-PSU, GPU and HDD/SSD
